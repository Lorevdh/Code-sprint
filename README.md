# 🏃‍♀️ Code Sprint

**Code Sprint** is a terminal-based Python game that teaches you programming logic through an interactive race.  
Originally built as a first Python project for the *Brain Jam* challenge with the theme: **Teach Me Something**.

## 🎯 What is it?

In Code Sprint, you guide an avatar through obstacles by choosing the correct Python code snippets.  
Each level introduces a concept like conditionals, loops, or functions.  
There are two game modes:  
- **Classic**: multiple-choice (A/B) code questions  
- **Challenge**: type Python code yourself, validated by the game  

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the game in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python code_sprint.py
   ```
2. Select your mode (1 = Classic, 2 = Challenge)  
3. Read the scenario and answer before the timer runs out  
4. Keep streaks to earn bonus points  
5. At the end, get a recap of the concepts you practiced  

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Conditionals: `if / elif / else`  
- Loops: `while` and `for`  
- Functions & reuse  
- Flow control: `break` / `continue`  
- Collections: lists & iteration  
- Bonus: Python trivia and fun facts  

## 🎨 Features

- Dynamic difficulty scaling (easy → medium → hard)  
- Themed runs (🌴 Jungle, 🚀 Space, ❄️ Ice, 🪨 Cave)  
- Fun Python facts shown during play  
- Bonus mini-challenges with typed code  
- Final score + motivational feedback  

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-sprint.git
   cd code-sprint
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install colorama
   ```
3. Start the game:
   ```bash
   python code_sprint.py
   ```

## 💡 Tips

- Answer before the timer ends — no input counts as wrong  
- Streaks earn you bonus points  
- Try both modes for more variety
