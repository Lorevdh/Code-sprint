# 🏃‍♀️ Code Sprint

**Code Sprint** is a short, terminal-based Python game created for the Brain Jam weekend challenge.  
The theme: **Teach Me Something** — and this game teaches players the basics of programming logic through interactive choices.

## 🎯 What is it?

In Code Sprint, players help an avatar complete a race by selecting the correct Python code snippets to overcome obstacles.  
Each level introduces a new concept like `if` statements, `while` loops, and variable logic — no prior coding experience required.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Run the game in any Python 3 environment (IDLE, VS Code, Replit, etc.)
- Read each scenario and choose the correct code snippet
- Your choices affect the outcome of the race
- Playable in under 5 minutes, with replayability built in

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- Conditional logic (`if`)
- Loops (`while`)
- Basic variable usage
- How programmers think through problems
